ISMAIL SHALASH,Wire Fraud and Laundering of Money Instruments,White-Collar Crime,na,"<p>Ismail Shalash is wanted for his alleged role in money laundering. Shalash would sell luxury vehicles online to owners of privately owned car dealerships in various states and never produce the promised product upon receipt of payment.

GEOFFREY JOHN BUSCH,Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud; Wire Fraud; Money Laundering,White-Collar Crime,na,"<p>Geoffrey John Busch is wanted for his alleged involvement in a scheme meant to defraud victim investors in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from in or about September of 2002, through in or about early 2006.  The object of the conspiracy and scheme to defraud was to have the victim investors send money for ""leased funds"" to be placed in non-existent bank accounts which could be used in high-yield trading programs that could generate huge returns; divert all of the victim investor funds for Busch's own benefit; and perpetuate the scheme by continuing to misrepresent to victim investors that their investments were safe and that they had access to the funds in the created accounts.  Busch's alleged misrepresentations and false documents caused the victim investors to wire transfer funds to banks in the Bahamas.  He then allegedly failed to obtain leased funds, earn profits for any of the victim investors, or return the transferred funds to the victim investors.  When the victim investors sought a refund of their funds, Busch allegedly claimed that it was the victim investors' fault that their money was not placed into a successful trade.  In the course of the scheme, Busch allegedly obtained over $12 million in proceeds from victim investors.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Busch was indicted in the United States District Court, Southern District of Florida, Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and a federal warrant was issued for his arrest on December 18, 2007, after he was charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering.</p>

Naovarath promised the Laotian victims that they would be ""investment partners"" on various Las Vegas properties that they would be purchasing. However, instead of being a partner on a legitimate real estate transaction, Naovarath merely used their identities to buy and then quickly resell (flip) the high-end properties.</p>

<p>In some cases, Naovarath used the same buyer to purchase several properties, incurring millions of dollars in mortgage debt. Most, if not all, of the properties within one entire up-scale Las Vegas community were purchased in the same fraudulent manner, resulting in numerous foreclosures and losses exceeding $10 million.</p>
